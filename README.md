# **Incredible Hillar Amberis - Tinkercad Project**

This is a 3D design project created using Tinkercad. The model showcases a creative and detailed design named **"Incredible Hillar Amberis."** It highlights my skills in 3D modeling, spatial visualization, and design using Tinkercad’s intuitive interface.

## **Project Overview**

- **Platform:** Tinkercad  
- **Project Name:** Incredible Hillar Amberis  
- **Link:** [View Project on Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/8rsvFW0yfoC-incredible-hillar-amberis)  
- **Description:** A unique and intricate 3D model designed with attention to detail and creativity. This project demonstrates my ability to work with shapes, alignments, and layering to produce a visually appealing design.

## **Features**

- Use of multiple shapes and forms combined to create a cohesive model  
- Demonstrates understanding of 3D space and object manipulation  
- Good use of color and layering to enhance visual impact

---

## **Tools Used**

- Tinkercad online 3D modeling tool  
- Basic geometric shapes and grouping techniques  
- Alignment and rotation tools for precision

## **Door Unlock Scenario (Right Password)**

In this scenario, the door unlocks successfully when the correct password is entered. The model visually represents the door in an open state, highlighting the mechanism that responds to the correct input.

- **Visual Cue:** The door is shown open/unlocked.  
- **Interaction:** Correct password triggers the unlocking mechanism.  
- **Purpose:** Demonstrates how user input can control physical elements in the design.

---

## **Door Locked Scenario (Wrong Password)**

This scenario shows the door remaining locked when an incorrect password is entered. The model depicts the door in a closed and secured state, indicating that access is denied.

- **Visual Cue:** The door remains closed/locked.  
- **Interaction:** Incorrect password results in no change to the door’s locked status.  
- **Purpose:** Illustrates the importance of password validation and access control within the model.

## **Future Enhancements**

- Add animation to the door unlocking and locking actions.  
- Integrate sensor simulations for password input recognition.  
- Expand the model to include additional interactive elements or security features.
